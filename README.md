# Spreedy - Text to Speech Robot

The `say` command on macOS is very helpful, but lacks pause, and on the fly rate of speech changes. I really wanted a portable file for this that I can run offline on my computer or phone. 

This was forked from https://codepen.io/ElaMoscicka/pen/MQyVbp which is work from the Wes Bos JS30 course. I added pause/resume, starting at a default faster rate.
